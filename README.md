# LED-Bike-Wheel
This is all of the code that I have created in the development and testing of my senior design project "LED Bike Wheel" at Arizona State University.
Most of the code is in Python and is made to run on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B+. 

In the end there are two python programs running on the Raspberry Pi which are responsible for the functioning of the LED Bike Wheel, these two programs are titled LEDcontrol and PolalrRead. PolarRead.py is capable of taking in an image (.jpg, .gif, .png) and doing the appropriate processing and saving the image data as a text file. This text file is then read by LEDcontrol.py which then properly coordinates the display of the LEDs on the bike wheel.
